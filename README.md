# Ristorante Con Fusion

  ## Description
  Ristorante Con Fusion is actually my old project from Coursera, which was originally hosted by the University of Hong Kong- prior to their dropping both that course and all of the related courses in that specialization before I had a chance to take them. I am keeping it around as a resource mostly, and perhaps a template, though I think I'll be learning React soon and the way I do websites will likely change.
